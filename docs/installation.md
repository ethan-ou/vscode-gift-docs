First, we'll download and install Visual Studio Code. Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click on the download button.

For Windows, run the installer. For Mac, extract the package to the Applications folder.

After you've installed Visual Studio Code, open the application.

Next, go to the Extensions panel by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar. If you can't find it, use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL+SHIFT+X`.

In the search bar, search for the **GIFT Language Pack** extension. Click on it and install the extension.

That's it! You now have everything you need to write in the GIFT format.

## Getting Familiar with Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, create a new file by going to `File > New File`, or by using the keyboard shortcut `CTRL+N`.

Next, we'll need to set the language of the document to the GIFT format. In the bottom right-hand corner, you'll see a group of buttons. One of these buttons has the name `Plain Text`.

Click on this button, and scroll through the options. You should see an option for `Gift`. Select it, and the GIFT Language will be enabled.
